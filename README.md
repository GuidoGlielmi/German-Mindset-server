# MINDSET - BACKEND.

**Version 1.0.0**

For this week (8th) we have to work on the backend for the mindset project 

As a group we had to work with branches to solve the given tasks.

The project has 3 main areas to focus in, these are:

 - Psychologist

 - Admins

 - Users/Applicants

---

## DEPENDENCIES INCLUDED.

First of all we need to download the last version of Node.js on [ClickHere](https://nodejs.org/es/download/).

In order to set up a server to work we made use of:

$ npm init

$ npm install express --save

$ npm install --save-dev nodemon

## STEPS TO BUILD AND RUN THE SERVER.

$ const express = require ('express');
$ const app= express();
$ const cors = require ('cors');
$ app.use(cors());
$ app.use(express.json());
$ app.use(express.static('public'));
$ const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000;
$ app.listen(PORT);
